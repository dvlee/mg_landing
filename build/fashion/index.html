					<div class="text-block__text">It enhances self-expression and self-perception. And of course, it’s also big money – valued globally at more than two trillion dollars. So it’s not surprising that seasoned, talented fashion photographers – who consistently deliver under these enormous demands – <em>are some of the most sought after shooters in the world.</em></div>
