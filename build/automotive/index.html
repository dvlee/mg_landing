					<div class="text-block__text"> – which also includes motorcycles and other vehicles – is a unique genre with unique challenges. Cars, by their nature, are very reflective. You’re not actually shooting the car, you’re shooting everything around it – the location, the specular highlights from the light source…everything. It will all show up on that beautiful sheet metal.<br><br><em>There are two popular ways to control those variables. Which divides automotive photographers into two camps.</em></div>

							It should be the story the automotive photographer is telling through the lens. So I go out and find the right location at the perfect time of day. I simplify the elements. I build the set and the lighting all in one place. Because the more I can accomplish in camera, the more real and authentic the final image will feel
