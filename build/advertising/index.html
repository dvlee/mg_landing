							In my opinion, there’s one very important distinction between advertising photography and every other kind of photography discipline. 
							<span class="highlight">Art, by definition, is open to interpretation.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="article__text">
							If two different people walk away from a fine art photograph or a painting or a sculpture with two different emotional interpretations, that’s okay. In fact, it’s great. But if two different people walk away from an advertising photograph with different interpretations, it’s a failure. Because advertising photography is all about solving a problem for the product in a clear and simple way.

						<div class="requires__text">With advertising, a lot of people have skin in the game. Sometimes people’s careers and reputations rely on the success or failure of a campaign.
