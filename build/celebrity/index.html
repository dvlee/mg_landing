							And now in the digital age, that image is accessible with just a simple click or search. Which makes a world-class celebrity photographer more valuable than ever. It’s not enough to simply make them look good. It’s my responsibility to elevate their image. To make them distinctive. To show the world a side of them that no one has ever seen before – which is no easy task for celebrities who may have already spent years or decades in the public eye. It’s a responsibility I take very seriously.

A great celebrity photographer has to be a people person who can interact with – sometimes intimidating – personalities and make them feel comfortable.
